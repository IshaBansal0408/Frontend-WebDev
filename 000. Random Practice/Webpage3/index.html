        <p>Social worker Emily Jenkins (Ren√©e Zellweger) is assigned to investigate the family of 10-year-old Lillith Sullivan (Jodelle Ferland), as her grades in school have declined and an emotional rift with her parents emerges. Emily suspects that the parents have been abusing Lillith, and proposes to her department to take the child away from her parents' custody. Emily's fears are confirmed when Lillith's parents try to kill her by roasting her in the oven at their home. Emily saves Lillith with the help of Detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane). Lillith is originally sent to a children's home but she begs Emily to look after her instead. With the agreement of the board, Emily is assigned to take care of Lillith until a suitable foster family comes along. In the mean time, Lillith's parents are placed in a mental institution.</p>

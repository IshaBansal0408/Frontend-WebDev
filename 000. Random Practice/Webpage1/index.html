        <p>A little imagination can sometimes go a long way. The story of young and artistically talented Jesse Aarons, who is sharing concerns and money problems with his family. He's having trouble at school with the bullies and there is a bully like troll who charges the kids a dollar to go and pee. He is fighting for the attention of his father, against his baby sister. Life for young Jesse isn't looking up, that is until the adventurous, imaginative and non-conformist Leslie Burke arrives in town. Together they form a bond and Jesse's life shall never, again, be the same. Adventures and amazement in other worlds center around these two kindred spirits, and for once, for Jesse, life isn't so bad after all. If your mind is wide enough then let your imagination take you over the Bridge to Terabithia.</p>
